# Cyber-Sources

This list is not exhaustive!

Here are a collection of sources that I have engaged with or find useful in no particular order.

I will do my best to explain the significance of each and why I find it useful as a resource in each individual file.

I will also update this list periodically as I see with respect to relevance to my use and my perceived relevance to the industry.


# Resource Categories

- [Cybersecurity Web Tools and Cheat Sheets](Tools.md)
- [Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC)](GRC.md)
- [Research, Intelligence, and Trends](Security_Intelligence.md)
- [Key Concepts & Frameworks](Concepts&Frameworks.md)
- [Content/Trainings/Creators I Recommend](Cyber_Media.md)


#To do

- Merge formatting, de-ai things to make in your own words, choose between having the webtools as the base to change the format for everything else or not.
- Decide on tone, naming conventions, and the organization of the document
- Maybe make the CVE a sub-sub file
