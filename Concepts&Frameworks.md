## Concepts 

### Pyramid of Pain  
- **Website**: [https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html](https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html)  
- **Description**: A concept that depicts the "pain" cybercriminals feel when they are denied at various levels of attack indicators, from hash values to tactics.

### Loeb Model  
- **Website**: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon%E2%80%93Loeb_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon%E2%80%93Loeb_model)  
- **Description**: A model used to estimate the optimal amount an organization should invest in cybersecurity to reduce the probability of a data breach.

## Frameworks 

### NIST SP 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls)  
- **Website**: [https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final) 
- **Description**: A comprehensive set of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. One of the key SP's mentioned for it's significance as a kind of security control "dictionary". Check to ensure the most recent version is viewed.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- **Website**: [https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)  
- **Description**: A voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risk. The other key NIST publication referenced frequently (CSF), the website also offers additional resources for organizations to set a baseline and goals for their cybersecurity programs.

## CVE System 

The **CVE system (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** is a standardized method for identifying and cataloging vulnerabilities in software and hardware. Most malware is identifies with a CVE score based on severity and potential/active exploitation. Below are some of the official websites and groups supporting the CVE and CVSS infrastructure.

### CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  
- **Website**: [https://www.cve.org/](https://www.cve.org/)  
- **Description**: A system that provides unique identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to track and manage them effectively.

### CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System  
- **Website**: [https://www.first.org/cvss/](https://www.first.org/cvss/)  
- **Description**: A standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. CVSS scores help organizations prioritize their response to vulnerabilities.

### NVD - National Vulnerability Database  
- **Website**: [https://nvd.nist.gov/](https://nvd.nist.gov/)  
- **Description**: A U.S. government repository of vulnerability management data, including CVE records and CVSS scores, maintained by NIST.

### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog  
- **Website**: [https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  
- **Description**: A list maintained by CISA that tracks actively exploited vulnerabilities based on CVE identifiers, helping organizations prioritize patching efforts.

### FIRST - Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  
- **Website**: [https://www.first.org](https://www.first.org)  
- **Description**: An organization that develops and maintains the CVSS framework and provides a CVSS calculator for organizations to assess the severity of vulnerabilities.
