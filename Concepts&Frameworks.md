## CVE System üõ†Ô∏è

The **CVE system (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** is a standardized method for identifying and cataloging vulnerabilities in software and hardware. Most malware is identifies with a CVE score based on severity and potential/active exploitation. Below are key components and related resources:

### CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  
- **Website**: [https://www.cve.org/](https://www.cve.org/)  
- **Description**: A system that provides unique identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to track and manage them effectively.

### CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System  
- **Website**: [https://www.first.org/cvss/](https://www.first.org/cvss/)  
- **Description**: A standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. CVSS scores help organizations prioritize their response to vulnerabilities.

### NVD - National Vulnerability Database  
- **Website**: [https://nvd.nist.gov/](https://nvd.nist.gov/)  
- **Description**: A U.S. government repository of vulnerability management data, including CVE records and CVSS scores, maintained by NIST.

### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog  
- **Website**: [https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  
- **Description**: A list maintained by CISA that tracks actively exploited vulnerabilities based on CVE identifiers, helping organizations prioritize patching efforts.

### FIRST - Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  
- **Website**: [https://www.first.org](https://www.first.org)  
- **Description**: An organization that develops and maintains the CVSS framework and provides a CVSS calculator for organizations to assess the severity of vulnerabilities.
