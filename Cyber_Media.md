# Edutainment, Training, and Creators/Content ðŸ“º

  This section highlights **cybersecurity media, training platforms, and content creators** that have provided valuable resources and insights. Below are their websites and platforms, along with a description for some of what they can provide, and maybe my experiences.

## Simply Cyber  
- **Website**: [https://www.simplycyber.io](https://www.simplycyber.io)  
- **Their YouTube**: [@SimplyCyber](https://www.youtube.com/@SimplyCyber)  
- **GitHub**: [DJBsec](https://github.com/DJBsec)  

**TLDR:**  
  Cybersecurity community that is very supportive and inclusive. They host the "Daily Cyber Threat Brief" weekdays going through some of the top cyber headlines. Their website also offers some training and additional resources (like the GitHub link attached). An awesome team works to support Simply Cyber and it is something I am happy to support too.

## BlackPerl  
- **Their YouTube**: [@BlackPerl](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackPerl)  
- **GitHub**: [archanchoudhury](https://github.com/archanchoudhury)  

**My thoughts:**  
  BlackPerl creates tons of great cybersecurity content, primarily focused on digital forensics. Their GitHub is a goldmine for various cyber resources/tools (some of which I have added to mine). I find their videos very informative, and would recommend at least glancing at his content for anyone interested in cyber, especially for those aiming to get into DFIR. (He also provides premium courses, I cannot speak on those as I have not taken them.)

## Eli The Computer Guy  
- **Website**: [https://www.silicondojo.com](https://www.silicondojo.com)  
- **Their YouTube**: [@elithecomputerguy](https://www.youtube.com/@elithecomputerguy)  

**My thoughts:**  
  I watched a decent amount of Eli's courses and I can say I have gained a lot from them, especially as someone starting out in IT. Eli offers plenty of videos, some personal, but much of his video content are full length lectures that he hosts from his class Silicon Dojo.
The courses are able to be attended live or watched afterwards, with a pay what you can if you can policy. Eli's videos cover various broad topics within IT (concepts, networking, cybersecurity, ppogramming, etc.) so there is plenty of content to absorb. In person (if you live nearby) Silicon Dojo hosts physical lectures where resources (like computers) are provided to follow along and engage in labs.

## Black Hills Information Security  
- **Website**: [https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com)  
- **Antisyphon Training**: [https://www.antisyphontraining.com](https://www.antisyphontraining.com)  
- **Their YouTube**: [@BlackHillsInformationSecurity](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackHillsInformationSecurity)  

**My thoughts:**  
  Black Hills offers high-quality training and regularly hosts webcasts/podcasts covering various cybersecurity topics on top of other information-rich videos. Black Hills, much like Simply Cyber, have a passionate team behind them, and a friendly community supporting them. They provide some products and resources, but what I have benefited from is their Antisyphon Training. The courses offered through Antisyphon are pay what you can funded, the courses are also posted online (on YouTube) in full length after the course completion. Antisyphon courses themselves are digital, anyone can join, and they also provide interactive labs for some of their courses with no additional cost. Antisyphon training is more geared towards specific skill building, so many of their courses align more with job preparation.

## Professor Messer  
- **Website**: [https://www.professormesser.com](https://www.professormesser.com)  
- **Their YouTube**: [@professormesser](https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser)  

**My thoughts:**  
  Professor Messerâ€™s content is well-organized and a household name for certification exam prep. He offers many resources on his website alongside his videos, some premium and some free. Messer's content is what helped me with my Security+ cert, and I am sure I will be back if I get any more certs from CompTIA!

## DFIR Diva  
- **Website**: [https://dfirdiva.com](https://dfirdiva.com)  

**My thoughts:**  
  DFIR Diva provides excellent resources for anyone interested in digital forensics and incident response. The website is a great starting point for building a career in DFIR and getting guidance on how to proceed with learning, training, or certification (with specific recomendations for affordability).
