## Malware Traffic (pcap) Analysis Practice
- **Website**: [https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/)

**My thoughts...**
 
To call this website an awesome resource is an understatement. This website, by Bradley Duncan, offers a wide variety of pcap files with malicious traffic examples inside. The website is set up for you to pick from a list of packet captures and assume the role of a security analyst as you complete the tasks given (usually reflecting identifying the maliscious traffic and other parts of the capture). The author also provides an answer sheet with some short explanations for each packet (mainly with WireShark), there are some other resources on the site as well. Fantastic resource for anyone wishing to better their skills of packet analysis.

## Mimo - Coding Practice/Learning App
- **Website**: [https://mimo.org/](https://mimo.org/)

**My thoughts...**
 
I discovered Mimo as an app to help me not get rusty at coding and had a great experience with their UI. Their service is free(with ads)/premium and this is the link to their website (and no I am not sponsored). Mimo has several different languages and in my opinion does a good job and is very accessible for practicing or even learning a new coding language on the go. The free version's ads are not invasive (as of me writing this early 2025) and the app has the same feel as Duolingo, I only have experienced using it on iOS but I believe it is avalaible on most other platforms. 

Me Rambling: My thoughts on Duolingo and learning speaking languages are better in a seperate tangent, but what I can say for Mimo is that the application to actual coding is very direct. In my experience taking learning courses online or in person, the structure of Mimo is very similiar to coding courses that slowly build your knowledge of the code will mixing in both guided and unguided coding challenges. I think the acccessibility of Mimo as a resource for (especially someone stretched for time) is it's biggest selling point, that combined with it's great UI and engaging content makes it worth mentioning for me.

## Simply Cyber  
- **Website**: [https://www.simplycyber.io](https://www.simplycyber.io)  
- **Their YouTube**: [@SimplyCyber](https://www.youtube.com/@SimplyCyber)  
- **GitHub**: [DJBsec](https://github.com/DJBsec)  

**My thoughts...**

A cybersecurity community that is very supportive and inclusive. They host the "Daily Cyber Threat Brief" weekdays going through some of the top cyber headlines. Their website also offers some training and additional resources (like the GitHub link attached). An awesome team works to support Simply Cyber and it is something I am happy to support too.

## BlackPerl  
- **Their YouTube**: [@BlackPerl](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackPerl)  
- **GitHub**: [archanchoudhury](https://github.com/archanchoudhury)  

**My thoughts...**

BlackPerl creates tons of great cybersecurity content, primarily focused on digital forensics. Their GitHub is a goldmine for various cyber resources/tools (some of which I have added to mine). I find their videos very informative, and would recommend at least glancing at his content for anyone interested in cyber, especially for those aiming to get into DFIR. (He also provides premium courses, I cannot speak on those as I have not taken them.)

## Eli The Computer Guy  
- **Website**: [https://www.silicondojo.com](https://www.silicondojo.com)  
- **Their YouTube**: [@elithecomputerguy](https://www.youtube.com/@elithecomputerguy)  

**My thoughts...**

I watched a decent amount of Eli's courses and I can say I have gained a lot from them, especially as someone starting out in IT. Eli offers plenty of videos, some personal, but much of his video content are full length lectures that he hosts from his class Silicon Dojo.
The courses are able to be attended live or watched afterwards, with a pay what you can if you can policy. Eli's videos cover various broad topics within IT (concepts, networking, cybersecurity, ppogramming, etc.) so there is plenty of content to absorb. In person (if you live nearby) Silicon Dojo hosts physical lectures where resources (like computers) are provided to follow along and engage in labs.

## Black Hills Information Security  
- **Website**: [https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com)  
- **Antisyphon Training**: [https://www.antisyphontraining.com](https://www.antisyphontraining.com)  
- **Their YouTube**: [@BlackHillsInformationSecurity](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackHillsInformationSecurity)  

**My thoughts...**

Black Hills offers high-quality training and regularly hosts webcasts/podcasts covering various cybersecurity topics on top of other information-rich videos. Black Hills, much like Simply Cyber, have a passionate team behind them, and a friendly community supporting them. They provide some products and resources, but what I have benefited from is their Antisyphon Training. The courses offered through Antisyphon are pay what you can funded, the courses are also posted online (on YouTube) in full length after the course completion. Antisyphon courses themselves are digital, anyone can join, and they also provide interactive labs for some of their courses with no additional cost. Antisyphon training is more geared towards specific skill building, so many of their courses align more with job preparation.

## Professor Messer  
- **Website**: [https://www.professormesser.com](https://www.professormesser.com)  
- **Their YouTube**: [@professormesser](https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser)  

**My thoughts...**

Professor Messerâ€™s content is well-organized and a household name for certification exam prep. He offers many resources on his website alongside his videos, some premium and some free. Messer's content is what helped me with my Security+ cert, and I am sure I will be back if I get any more certs from CompTIA!

## Unit 42 - Palo Alto Networks
- **Main Website**: [https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com)
- **Learning Hub**: [https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/learning-hub/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/learning-hub/)  
- **Cybersecurity Tutorial Archives**: [https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/cybersecurity-tutorials/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/cybersecurity-tutorials/)  

**My thoughts...**

So I have mentioned unit 42 under the security researcher umbrella but I wanted to highlight their educational content here. They have plenty of resources on their website but two I will highlight are their Learning Hub Archives and their Cybersecurity Tutorial Archives. These two have some fantastic tutorials introducing and refining some key skills and mentions some great topics. All of this content is accompanied by clear explanations and very helpful visuals to guide your understanding.

## DFIR Diva  
- **Website**: [https://dfirdiva.com](https://dfirdiva.com)  

**My thoughts...**
 
DFIR Diva provides excellent resources for anyone interested in digital forensics and incident response. The website is a great starting point for building a career in DFIR and getting guidance on how to proceed with learning, training, or certification (with specific recomendations for affordability).
